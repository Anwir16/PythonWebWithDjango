# Number Guessing Game
This is my first project using Django to create a web application with Python.

To run project must install:
1. python -m pip install --upgrade pip
2. pip install -r requirements.txt
3. python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip

To run a web site:
1. Open folder you want to save your project on VSCode
2. Run terminal and enter code: cd MyApp
3. And then Enter python manage.py migrate
4. To run your project on localhost enter python manage.py runserver
